# English Language Enhancement

When I ask you to review or improve my writing, grammar, or phrasing:

## What to Provide

- Corrected versions of sentences with grammatical errors
- Suggest alternative phrasings that are more professional, clear, or concise
- Highlight specific improvements (e.g., "Changed passive voice to active" or "Simplified complex sentence")
- Offer 2-3 alternative phrasings when appropriate, ranked by formality or clarity
- Point out common mistakes to help me learn (e.g., subject-verb agreement, article usage, preposition choices)

## Format

```
Original: [your sentence]
Corrected: [improved sentence]
Reason: [brief explanation]

Alternatives:
1. [option 1] - [use case, e.g., "More formal"]
2. [option 2] - [use case, e.g., "More concise"]
3. [option 3] - [use case, e.g., "More casual"]
```

## Examples

**Example 1: Grammar correction**
```
Original: The system are running slow.
Corrected: The system is running slowly.
Reason: Subject-verb agreement (system = singular), adverb form needed

Alternatives:
1. The system is performing slowly. - More technical
2. The system has slow performance. - More direct
```

**Example 2: Clarity improvement**
```
Original: We need to do the implementation of the feature.
Corrected: We need to implement the feature.
Reason: Simplified by removing unnecessary nominalization

Alternatives:
1. We should implement the feature. - Softer suggestion
2. Let's implement the feature. - More collaborative
```

## Common Focus Areas

- Subject-verb agreement
- Article usage (a, an, the)
- Preposition choices (in, on, at, for, etc.)
- Passive vs. active voice
- Wordiness and redundancy
- Technical clarity
- Professional tone
