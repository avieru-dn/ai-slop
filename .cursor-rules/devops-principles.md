# DevOps Principles and Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Avoid manual interventions
- Use CI/CD for deployments
- Implement automated testing

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Define infrastructure in version-controlled files
- Use Terraform, ARM templates, or similar tools
- Make infrastructure reproducible
- Document infrastructure changes in code

### Security First
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Use managed identities over service principals
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Implement security scanning in pipelines
- Use secret management tools (Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault)

### Idempotency
- Scripts and automation should be safely re-runnable
- Same input = same output, regardless of how many times executed
- No side effects from multiple executions

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Never hardcode sensitive values
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Store secrets in secure vaults
- Document required variables

### Error Handling
- Include proper error handling in all scripts
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### Input Validation
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Use type checking where possible
- Sanitize user inputs

## Logging and Monitoring

### Logging Standards
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include timestamps and correlation IDs
- Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Don't log sensitive information

### Monitoring
- Implement health checks
- Set up alerting for critical issues
- Monitor resource usage
- Track key performance indicators

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployments
- Maintain two identical environments
- Switch traffic between them
- Enable quick rollbacks

### Canary Deployments
- Gradually roll out changes
- Monitor metrics during rollout
- Automatic rollback on failures

### Rolling Updates
- Update instances gradually
- Maintain availability during updates
- Validate each step before proceeding

## Version Control

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches
- Implement pull request reviews
- Protect main/master branch
- Tag releases

### Commit Practices
- Follow conventional commits format
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid
- Unit tests (base)
- Integration tests (middle)
- End-to-end tests (top)

### Test Automation
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Block merges on test failures
- Maintain test coverage metrics
- Test infrastructure code

## Cost Optimization

- Use appropriate resource sizing
- Implement auto-scaling
- Clean up unused resources
- Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Tag resources for cost tracking

## Disaster Recovery

- Implement backup strategies
- Test restore procedures
- Document recovery procedures
- Define RPO and RTO
- Use geo-redundancy for critical systems
